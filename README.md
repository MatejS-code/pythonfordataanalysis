# Python for Data Analysis

Project 1: Analyzing Amazon Sales Data

In this project I answered the requested business questions: 
- How many sales have they made with amounts more than 1000 
- How many sales have they made that belong to the category "Tops"  and have a quantity of 3 
- Total Sales by Category 
- Average Amount by Category and Status 
- Total Sales by Fulfillment and Shipment Type

Tasks completed: 
- Cleaned data (removed nulls, checked data types)
- Performed data exploration
- Performed aggregations to create dataframes for investors
